# SHADE â€˜22 Datathon Team 14: Antiplatelet therapy for myocardial injury in ICU patients
This project was done during the SG Healthcare AI Datathon 2022(SHADE22). 

## Clinical question
Is antiplatelet therapy beneficial for patients who had myocardial injury during their stay in the ICU?

## Background
- Management of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction (MI) or myocardial injury is a recognized gap in existing knowledge.
- JACC 2022 Expert Consensus guidelines recommend that where there is uncertainty regarding whether the diagnosis is a type 1 or type 2 MI (T2MI), clinicians should generally manage as presumed type 1 MI (T1MI)

## Problem Statement
Determine if there is an association between initiation of antiplatelet medical medical therapy for patients in ICU with myocardial injury, and mortality

## Method
From the MIMIC-IV database,

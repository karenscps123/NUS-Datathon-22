# Antiplatelet therapy for myocardial injury in ICU patients
This project was done during the SG Healthcare AI Datathon 2022(SHADE22). 

## Clinical question
Is antiplatelet therapy beneficial for patients who had myocardial injury during their stay in the ICU?

## Background
- Management of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction (MI) or myocardial injury is a recognized gap in existing knowledge.
- JACC 2022 Expert Consensus guidelines recommend that where there is uncertainty regarding whether the diagnosis is a type 1 or type 2 MI (T2MI), clinicians should generally manage as presumed type 1 MI (T1MI)

## Problem Statement
Determine if there is an association between initiation of antiplatelet medical medical therapy for patients in ICU with myocardial injury, and mortality

## Method
From the MIMIC-IV database,

# Conclusion 
While there is a slight difference in mortality percentage, the minimal difference suggest that antiplatelet therapy does not yield much morality benefits for patients who had myocardial injury during their stay in the ICU. The side effects/complications of the antiplatelet therapy might even outweigh its benefits for the more vulnerable patients.
